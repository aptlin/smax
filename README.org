* Installation

  To install, clone this repository to `$HOME/.emacs.d`.

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

  Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
  packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
  encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
  running ~M-x package-refresh-contents~ before doing so.

* Updates

  Enter the ~/.emacs.d~ directory and execute ~git pull~.

  To update the third-party packages, proceed as follows with emacs open:

  ~M-x package-list-packages~, then ~U~ followed by ~x~.
