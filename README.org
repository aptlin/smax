  Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
  packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
  encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
  running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.

* Updates

  Enter the ~/.emacs.d directory and execute #git pull#.

  To update the third-party packages, proceed as follows with emacs open:

  #M-x package-list-packages#, then #U# followed by #x#.
